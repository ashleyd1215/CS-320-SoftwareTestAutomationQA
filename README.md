How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

How I made sure everything was functional and secure was by writing a couple of lines of code and running it checking for errors. I would fix any error to and than run it again. Once all errors were fixed, I know that its ready to go.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I will take the requirements given to me and make sure that are included in code. If the requirements are not met then the client/user wouldn't like it and might scap the whole thing. I would make sure that all functions work so each requirement is reached. 

How do I approach designing software?

I focus on the requirements of the user. Once all the requirements are met, then I will focus on everything else. Meeting the requirements is key to making the app that the user wants.
